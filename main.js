// Technical Requirements
//
// Your app must:
//
// Render a game board in the browser
// Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
// Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
// Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
// Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
// Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
// Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
// Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

/////////////////CLINTON VS TRUMP///////////////////////
//Data
// Track placement of tokens.
  //How do I know if 3 of the same token are matched in the same line?
    // Total of 8 configs, 3 horizontal, 3 vertical, 2 diagonal
    // Vertical Combo wins
    // 1, 7 & 4
    // 2, 5 & 8
    // 3, 6 & 9
    //Horizontal Combo wins
    // 1, 2 & 3
    // 4, 5 & 6
    // 7, 8 & 9
    //Diagonal wins
    //3, 5 & 7
    //1, 5 & 9
    //There would need to be a condition that would check each time if any of these matched
    //If it does, then win theme
// If a token flipped on a square, it can only happen once, it can't be flipped again (i could use that click once jquery thing)
  // Switch from player one to player two (?? I need to work this out)
    //

//Presentation

//I need a large square to represent the game board
// Then 9 squares that will sit inside
// Heading
// Start button
// Tokens
//When matched, a win theme (music, background change)
  // Name of player + WINS! (a button to replay)

//Style
// Heading = american colors (blue, white, red)
// Background = white house
// Gameboard = white stars on blue background
  //separated by red lines
//Tokens, trump and clinton faces
//Start button

//DOM manipulation

//When a square is clicked, it flips to show either trump or clinton depending on who clicks it
  //I need to be able to set this up so it knows wether it is player one or player two clicking
    //This then need to keep a register of where that has been clicked
      //And if there are 3 in a row, then trigger the win theme for that player
//When 3 in a row match, then theme change indicating there's a win, music playing, background change


//Animate the start button, with a hover type animation




//TESTING flipping one square to show an image
$squareOne = $(".square.one");
$squareOne.on("click", function (){
  $squareOne.css({
    backgroundImage : "url(images/clintonTwo.jpg)",
    backgroundSize : "100%"
  });
});
$squareTwo = $(".square.two");
$squareTwo.on("click", function (){
  $squareTwo.css({
    backgroundImage : "url(images/trump.jpg)",
    backgroundSize : "100%"
  });
});

//How can I make this dynamic, so that it can be any square, and it will show either clinton or trump
  //If player one has click event on square, then show clinton jpg
    //If player two has click event on square, then show trump jpg

//Then a function would need to be run to check if the condition of a match to be true
  //If it is return win theme
    // If not continue play
